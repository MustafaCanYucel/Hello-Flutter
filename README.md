# üì± Hello Flutter - Learning Repository

This is a personal learning archive for my journey with **Flutter** and **Dart**, covering key widgets, UI patterns, and persistent storage with `shared_preferences` and `isar`.

## üß† About

**Flutter** is an open-source UI toolkit created by Google, first released in **2017**. It allows developers to build cross-platform mobile, web, and desktop apps with a single codebase.  
**Dart** is the underlying programming language, optimized for UI and compiled for fast performance.

This repository contains practical lessons and widget experiments built while learning Flutter step by step.
