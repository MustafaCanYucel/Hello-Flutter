# Lesson 00: Dart Language Overview

This branch contains a concise overview of fundamental concepts in the Dart programming language. It includes working examples of:

- Variable declarations (var, const, final, num, int, double, bool)
- Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `forEach`)
- Lists and Maps
- Null safety handling
- Class creation and object instantiation
- Simple function and object usage patterns

This code is a practical walkthrough for those getting started with Dart, designed to mirror real-world logic flow in a structured manner.

## ðŸ’¡ Background & Learning Philosophy

Before learning Dart, I completed a comprehensive deep-dive into the **Swift** programming language, including its paradigms, memory model, type system, and functional concepts. You can view that work in my detailed academic project here:

ðŸ“Ž [Principles-of-Swift Repository](https://github.com/MustafaCanYucel/Principles-of-Swift)

Thanks to the foundational understanding I gained from Swift, I was able to pick up Dart much faster by recognizing shared principles and patterns (e.g. static typing, object orientation, value/reference types, type inference, etc.).

## ðŸ§  Key Learning Highlights in Dart

- Understanding Dartâ€™s type system and null safety
- Working with control flow and comparison operators
- Using `List` and `Map` as primary collection types
- Implementing object-oriented logic through custom `class`
- Practicing real-world logic with loops and conditional checks

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Create a Dart project using:

```bash
dart create dart_overview
